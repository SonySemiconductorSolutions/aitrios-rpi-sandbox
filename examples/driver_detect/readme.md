In this article, I will introduce a method for using 


This article explores the use of an object detection model to detect whether a driver is using a mobile phone. Specifically, we utilize the object detection model "nanodet_plus_416x416_pp" from Model Zoo to identify  the mobile phone. If a mobile phone is detected, an alarm sound and an email notification will be triggered to warn that the driver may be using their phone.


1, First update

    $ sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade 

2, Install the imx500

    $ sudo apt install imx500-all

3, confirm the Linux Kernel version

    uname -a
    $ Linux raspberrypi 6.6.62+rpt-rpi-2712 #1 SMP PREEMPT Debian 1:6.6.62-1+rpt1 (2024-11-25) aarch64 GNU/Linux
    
4, Clone github and run the script

    $ git clone <https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2>
    $ cd ~/picamera2/examples/driver_detect
    $ python driver_detect.py --model /usr/share/imx500-models/imx500_network_nanodet_plus_416x416_pp.rpk


- When detecting the cell phone
Cell phone usage time will be informed and the alarm with using espeak: ("Warning! Warning! Cell phone detected! Cell phone detected! Please do not use cell phone during driving")
